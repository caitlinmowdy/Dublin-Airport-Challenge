See attached some files for the daa hackathon:

•	train_unhashed_examples.csv > a non-hashed sample of records so that the contestants can see some real data points and get a better intuition for the dataset

•	data_dictionary.pdf > a description of each column in the data

•	daa_hackathon_starter_code.py / daa_hackathon_starter_code.r > Some R and Python code to read in the data and generate a simple prediction to show what we are trying to predict and how we are measuring the model error
